%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This is optional and is included only for those students
% who want to use it.
%
% To the hyperref package, uncomment the following line:
%\usepackage{hyperref}
%
% Note that you should also uncomment the following line:
%\renewcommand{\theHchapter}{\thepart.\thechapter}
%
% to work around some a problem hyperref has with the fact
% the psuthesis class has unnumbered pages after which page
% counters are reset.

% Set the baselinestretch using the setspace package.
% The LaTeX Companion claims that a \baselinestretch of
% 1.24 gives one-and-a-half line spacing, which is allowed
% by the PSU thesis office. As of October 18, 2013, the Graduate
% School states ``The text of an eTD may be single-, double- or
% one- and-a-half-spaced.'' Go nuts!
